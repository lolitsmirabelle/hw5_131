```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(ISLR)
library(ISLR2)
library(tidyverse)
library(glmnet)
tidymodels_prefer()
```

## Question 1

```{r}
install.packages("janitor")
library(janitor)

pokemon_og <- read.csv("~/Downloads/homework-5/data/pokemon.csv")

pokemon <- clean_names(pokemon_og)
```
The clean_names() function cleans names of the data frame

## Question 2 

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
